# How to Compile and Execute the Program:

1. Compile using the following command: "make" (DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   A file named "a.out" is generated.

2.1- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -l -v -a" (DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   All types of output will be displayed on the screen.

2.2-  Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -l"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes).
   
2.3- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for virtual machine execution trace.
   
2.4- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -a"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the parser and code generation.
   
2.5- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -l -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes) and virtual machine execution trace.

2.6- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -l -a"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes) and parser and code generation.
   
2.7- Execute Test 1 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt -a -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the parser and code generation and virtual machine execution trace.

3.1- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -l -v -a" (DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Full output will be displayed on the screen.

3.2-  Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -l"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes).
   
3.3- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for virtual machine execution trace.
   
3.4- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -a"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the parser and code generation.
   
3.5- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -l -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes) and virtual machine execution trace.

3.6- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -l -a"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the lexical analyser (a list of tokens/lexemes) and parser and code generation.
   
3.7- Execute Test 2 using the following: "./a.out test2.txt -a -v"(DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   Output will be displayed on the screen for the parser and code generation and virtual machine execution trace.
   
4. Execute Test 1 or 2 using the following: "./a.out test1.txt"(DO NOT include the quotation marks, use either test1.txt or test2.txt)
   No output will be printed

5. Execute the given tester script using: "bash tester.sh" (DO NOT include the quotation marks)
   If the output is correct and both files match, the output on the screen prints "pass" for both cases.
